    <h1>ArrayList vs LinkedList</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
      The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. However,
      the limitation of the array is that the size of the array is predefined
      and fixed. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. In this article,
      the difference between two classes which are implemented to solve this
      problem named ArrayList and LinkedList is discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ArrayList is a part of the collection framework. It is present in the
      java.util package and provides us dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may
      be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful in programs where lots
      of manipulation in the array is needed. We can dynamically add and remove
      items. It automatically resizes itself. The following is an example to
      demonstrate the implementation of the ArrayList.

      LinkedList This class implements the LinkedList Data Structure. Linked
      List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in
      contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data
      part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and
      addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease
      of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays. The
      following is an example to demonstrate the implementation of the
      LinkedList.
